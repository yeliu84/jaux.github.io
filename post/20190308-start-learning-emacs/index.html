    <h2 class="title"><a href="#">Start Learning Emacs</a></h2>
    <div class="date">Mar 8, 2019</div>
    <div class="content"><p><em>March 7th, 2019.</em></p>

<p>I need to mark this date because on that day I decided to <strong>seriously</strong> learn Emacs and switch to it as my primary text editor after my 12 years Vim journey.</p>

<p>Why? Because currently I am working on the new design of <a href="https://gemsby.com">Gemsby</a> and I have chosen to use TypeScript for the work. Unfortunately, TypeScript support in Vim is very weak at this moment, I need to spend a lot of time to fight my text editor which I would rather not to do. And the plugins&rsquo; development seems to be moving very slowly. This is critial becase TypeScript the language itself is moving very quickly, if the plugins can&rsquo;t keep up with the pace, developers will abandon the editor, then I will have no choice but switch to a different text editor&hellip; 😢</p>

<p>Then, I have stumbled on this video a few days ago:</p>

<p>I actually have been thinking about trying Emacs again for quite some time now since my previous encounter with spacemacs, but I have never felt the urgency. This video is very interesting, and it is so convincing at the same time, which has led me to where I am right now &ndash; writing this blog post in Emacs!</p>

<p>I want to learn Emacs properly, so I am using the Homebrew&rsquo;s stock configuration and following the tutorial. I am like a 4-year old typing on a computer for the first time in this editor, the speed is very slow, and I am learning new commands and fighting with my Vim muscle memory at the same time 😖.</p>

<p>It is very painful, but no pain no gain! This time I will keep learning and make Emacs my new text editor of choice.</p>
